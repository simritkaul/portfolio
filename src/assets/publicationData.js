        publicationName: 'Efficient in-depth analysis and optimum design parameter estimation of MEMS capacitive pressure sensor utilizing analytical approach for square diaphragm',
        journalName: 'JCEL',
        publicationDescription: 'In this work, a complete formulation for analysis of capacitive pressure sensor with the square diaphragm in normal and touch mode operation has been presented as these two modes are established operating modes for these sensors. A comprehensive study of sensor parameters like capacitance, diaphragm deflection, capacitive and mechanical sensitivity has been formulated to aid the choice of sensor characteristics.',
